# C Lite Project Template

This template provides the minimal things you need to start a new C project. It supports essential features, such as:

 * [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) support for building application, libraries and tests
 * [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) support for CI/CD

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build the sample project from source, the following tools are needed:

 * git
 * make
 * gcc

On Ubuntu/Debian, you can install them with:

```shell
  sudo apt-get install git build-essential
```

On other platforms, please use the corresponding package managing tool to install them before proceeding.

### Building

You can get the source by "git clone" this git repository.

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/info1-r1042/c-template-lite.git
```

To build the sample application execute the following:

```shell
  cd c-template-lite
  make
```

### Running

To run the sample application execute the following:

```shell
  ./bin/app
```
You should see something like this:
